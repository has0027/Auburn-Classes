Question 1
The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model has 7 layers.
  True
 
Question 2
In the OSI model, the network layer is the 4th layer from the bottom.
  False
 
Question 3
The five layers in the Internet protocol stack are: the application layer, the transport layer, the session layer, the network layer, and the physical layer.
  False
 
Question 4
In general, packet switching performs well for bursty data.
  True

Question 5
The main difference between virus and worms is that virus can be self-replicated; no human interaction is required.
  False
 
Question 6
Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender repeatedly generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time. A packet-switched network would be more appropriate for this application.
  False
 
Question 7
Modularization simplifies the design and implementation of network systems by separating the interface from implementation.
  True

Question 8
Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is a technique used in some circuit switches.
  False

The maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress at any time is 16.
  True
 
Question 10
A user requests a Web page that consists of some text and three images, each of which is addressed by a URL. For this page, the client will send one request message and receive four response messages.
  False
 
Question 11
Two distinct Webpages (for example, www.auburn.edu/research.html and www.auburn.edu/students.html) can be sent over the same persistent connection.
  True
 
Question 12
With non-persistent connections between the browser and the origin server, it is possible to send two distinct HTTP request messages through one connection.
  False

Question 13
The Date: header in the HTTP response message indicates when the object in the response was last modified.
  False
 
Question 14
HTTP response messages may contain an empty message body.
  True
 
Question 15
Suppose there are N routers from source to destination. Let L denotes the number of bits in a packet, R denotes the transmission rate.  What is the total end-to-end delay in sending one packet from source to destination?
  N*L/R
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Answer Questions 16 and 17 using the following information. Suppose there are in total 15 users sharing a 200 Mbps link. Also suppose each user requires a bandwidth of 25 Mbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 30 percent of the time.
 
Question 16
Suppose circuit switching is used, what is the maximum number of users that can be supported?
  8
 
Question 17
Suppose packet switching is used, what is the probability that exactly one user is transmitting?
  0.031

Answer Questions 18 to 22 using the following information:

When a packet is being forwarded by a router to another router in a network, there are often some delays. Let L denotes packet length (bits), R denotes link bandwidth(bps), x denotes length of a physical link, s denotes propagation speed in medium, n denotes number of packets in the queue, k denotes number of bits in the packet that has currently been transmit.
 
Question 18
Consider all the delay components when sending a packet from a source host to a destination host over a fixed route. Which of these delays is variable?
  Queuing delays
 
Question 19
How is transmission delay calculated or estimated?
  d = L/R
 
Question 20
How is queuing delay calculated or estimated?
  Time waiting at output link for transmission. d = ((L-k)+N*L)/R  

Question 21
How is processing delay calculated or estimated?
  Normally less than 1 msec
 
Question 22
How is propagation delay calculated or estimated?
  d = x/s

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 23
What are the two key functions for the network layer in the Internet?
  Routing and Forwarding
 
Question 24
Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host are R1 and R2, respectively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length L? (Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.)
  L/R1 + L/R2
 
Question 25
Again, suppose as in the previous question that there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host are both R, respectively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send three packets of length L each? (Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.)
  4L/R

Answer Questions 26 to 28 using the following information:

Consider the scenario shown below, where there are 3 connections between the client and the server. Each connection consists of 5 links with transmission rates as shown in Figure 2. All connections use a shared link R, whose capacity of 120 Mbps is shared equally among the 3 connections.
 
Question 26
What is the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for the client and the server if only one connection can be used?
  40 Mbps
 
Question 27
If the server can use all 3 parallel connections to send data, what is the maximum throughput that the server can achieve?
  100 Mbps
 
Question 28
Assuming that the server is sending at the maximum rate possible, what is the link utilization for the shared link R?
  83%


Question 29
Suppose there is a router that is transmitting packets. Each packet has a length of 12000 bits and is transmitted over a single link with a transmission rate of 1 Mbps to another router at the other end of the link. What is the maximum number of packets per second that can be transmitted by this link?
  83 packets/sec
 
Question 30
The following are the Inter-networking principles that are used for successfully developing the Internet:

      i. Stateless routers

      ii. Reliable connections

     iii. Decentralized control

      iv. Minimalism and autonomy

  i, iii and iv only
 
Question 31
What is the main reason for using layering principle for organizing the different modules of a complex network system?
  It prevents deadlocks
 
Question 32
To simplify development of complex network systems, we break the system into simpler modules, where each module consist of two parts: (1) interface which is well-known and accessible by users, and (2) implementation which is hidden from users. What is the main purpose for hiding the implementation?
  The implementation can be modified without modifying the user programs
 
Question 33
What is the main reason why the client-server model is used more widely for developing network applications than the peer-to-peer model?
  The client-server model is simpler and recovers from failure easily
 
Question 34
Why are most network applications in the Internet based on stateless client-server model, e.g. stateless HTTP protocol?
  It is difficult to maintain states of the server and client that are consistent with each other
