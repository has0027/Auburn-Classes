The nosj data format is the latest and greatest way to serialize data such that
it can be shared across arbitrary mediums. Although formats like JSON, XML, and
protocol-buffers already exist, they do not subscribe to nosj's philosophy of
"No one ever needs more than three data-types!". That's why we are publishing
nosj to the world. Its simple and easy-to-use interface allows even the most
complex data structures to be represented in an easy-to-use and
easy-to-understand way.

# SUMMARY
################################################################################
A nosj object consists of a root-level map containing zero or more key-value
pairs (see map data-type). When the object is in its marshalled-state
white-space is irrelevant outside of white-space within the string data-type and
map-key elements described below. There is NOT a canonical comment for
marshalled nosj data.

# DATA-TYPES
################################################################################
The nosj format consists of three data-types: maps, integers, and strings. Each
is described in-depth below.

# Data-Type: map
A nosj map is a sequence of zero or more key-value pairs that take the form of
{key-1:value-1, key-2:value-2, ...} similar to the traditional hash-map data
structure. Values may take the form of any of the canonical nosj data-types and
maps may be nested to an arbitrary depth. Keys, on the otherhand MUST be an
ascii string consisting of one or more of the following:
- Upper or lowercase letters "a" through "z"
- Numerical digits "0" through "9"
- The characters " " (space), "-", "_", "+", and "."

# Data-Type: integer
A nosj integer represents a whole-number value between positive-infinity and
negative-infinity. A marshalled integer consists of the ascii-character "i", an
optional negative-sign ("-"), and one or more ascii-digits ("0" through "9").

# Data-Type: string
A nosj string is a sequence of ascii bytes bytes which can be used to represent
arbitrary internal data such as unicode or raw-binary. There are two distinct
representations of a nosj string data-type as described below.

### Representation #1: Simple Strings
In the simple representation, the string is restricted to printable ascii
characters excluding the "%" and "," characters (of note, this includes the
space-character (0x20) but not tab, new-line, DEL, or ESC). This representation
is annotated by a trailing "s" which is NOT part of the data being encoded.

### Representation #2: Complex Strings
In the complex representation, the string is percent-encoded identical to the
way it is done for a URL. Arbitrary bytes may be represented this way but a
complex string MUST have at least one percent-encoded representation.
