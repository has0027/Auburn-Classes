For Alice I have a wired connection and a wireless connection shown. The router has OpenWrt which we can use to create a bandwidth limiter for Bob to prevent the bandwidth from getting drained. As for the VPN, pfsense can be configured with OpenVPN. I blocked recommended dangerous outbound traffic from ports: 69, 135, 137, 138, 139, 161, 162, 445, 514, and 6660-6669. I also blocked anything having to do with remote login such as ssh and rdp.
